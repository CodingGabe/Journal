<p>My name is Gabe Amaya, and I am a self taught Web Developer by way of Austin, Texas.
I started teaching my self how to code back in the fall of 2015 and have just become a
professional in 2017. I used to work in the public sector as an admin. </p>

<p>I have changed this website, which used to be my portfolio, to document my journey
as a Web Developer and share everything that I have learned so that somebody, somewhere
will be inspired and find it helpful for their journey as well.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from others and blogs just like this so I will continue to update
even if I don't have an audience. I have big dreams as a Web Developer so I encourage you
to check me out on <a href="https://twitter.com/King_Gabes">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://github.com/CodingGabe">GitHub</a>.</p>
