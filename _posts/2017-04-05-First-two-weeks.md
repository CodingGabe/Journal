Beginning of my career as a Web Developer.

# My First 2 weeks!

Hey guys, if you are reading this you're too late. jk. Shout out to Drizzy Drake.

I got caught up in my first two weeks in my first professional job as a Web Dev.
I have had so much fun learning how teams work and think. Learning how it is to
work at a startup as well.

I come from working the corporate, boring, sit at your desk from 8 to 5 type role.
Getting up everyday at 5:30 am to workout and fight traffic was eating at my soul.
In addition to that, I was dying just sitting at my boring cubicle bored as can be
after I got all of my clerical work done. I do admit that being bored gave me a
chance to use the free resources from the net to sharpen my Dev skills though.

## The Culture

Enter, startup culture.  It is still taking me some time to adjust to free snacks
in the kitchen, massages, having a chef cook meals and unlimited drinks to choose from.
At my last two jobs, people would've been savages to grab anything free. Also having
a the ability to order any setup of my choosing. Of course I went with Mac Pro on a stand
with smart mouse/keyboard and 27 inch Mac Monitor with standing desk. Love it. I'm
super productive as a result and the day flies. Seriously, it's already lunch time
by the time I get done with a small tweak on a site.

## Average Day

My daily routine is to come in. Browse [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) :), read emails,
and log in to our company's project manager. Which is [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/). I find a project that the designer or Sr. Dev left for me. I get there early, by the way, because of traffic. The designer will design a nice mockup and slack it to me throughout the day and I will develop it in my text editor or WordPress.

That's all for now, I will update after this week for more on my daily routine, but to conclude, I am really enjoying this rewarding career and encourage anyone who loves Web Dev or Design to go for it.

P.S. the company had a huge boat party on the lake to show me how they role. Yet another small perk to enjoy for putting in serious work self-teaching.
