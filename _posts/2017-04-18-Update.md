Just wanted to update you guys on what I have been doing on the job. The Sr. Developer
was on vacation for two weeks so I will be grinding from here on out.

While he was away I was in charge of small tasks like updates on font sizes, colors,
bugs on WordPress sites and a small ad campaign. Nothing too serious.

I was always busy diving into React pretty hard. I plan on building exciting apps as side projects in React when I master the language. Exciting stuff.

I should have a cooler update next week when I start doing bigger projects for the company. For now, I can say that I still love my job and everyone here. I still come home daily and work on side projects and play games. Check out my latest and coolest project [The 512 Goons](https://codinggabe.github.io/512-Goons/).
