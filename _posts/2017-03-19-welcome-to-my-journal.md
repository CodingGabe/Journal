Thanks for checking me out. If you are reading this, it means you want to know
how I got here and where I am heading. This blog site is intended to track my Journey as a Web Developer and see my progression as I set my goals higher and
higher every day. My true journey starts tomorrow (March 20, 2017) as it will
be my first day as a Jr. Front End Web Developer. I have been self-teaching since November 2015 and I am finally going to make my dream a reality. Join me as I will post weekly with what it is like and what I'm doing. Thanks for reading. Stay
tuned!
