## My First day as a Jr. Front End Developer

I was nervous to step into my first day as a professional Web Dev. I have been
doing this for a little over a year and a half and yet I was still losing sleep
over the fact that I didn't think I was good enough. The term commonly know as
[Imposter Syndrome](https://davidwalsh.name/impostor-syndrome) comes to mind.


I didn't know how traffic would fare so I woke up early and went straight there,
arriving 2 hours early. I hit the gym and was still anxious.


Walked in, met the team and got the tour and knew it was my new home. It was
very pleasant and welcoming and they went out of their way to make me comfortable.


Took awhile to set up my environment but I think I got everything set up for the
most part. Set up my Mac and standing desk and I was off to the races to learn how
the company operates.


I had some fun learning how the team thinks and I am confident that I will fit right
in. As far as the coding goes, I am confident that I will be a huge asset to the team.
They, pardon me, use a couple of site builders but we do a lot of customization so it
should be a lot of fun getting to be creative.


I look forward to learning the remainder of the week and will update a lot for the
first week. As always, thanks for reading.
