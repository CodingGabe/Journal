A heads up on what's going down as my first month is complete!

#WordPress

Yup, that's correct, lots of WordPress. I knew a little of the basics but the company is
moving everything to WordPress, which is a good thing as they were using a completely outdated
system and no version control. Some might think WordPress is just a drag and drop, while that may be
a little true, if you want to produce quality work than you have to dig deep into the code
and add some customization.

I have been providing modern practices to implement into the existing content and trying to make
it easier and better for users along with a rebranding for better visuals. It's been pleasant and
I have learned a ton more about how WordPress works and how it is beneficial to clients.

I plan on being a lot busier in the Summer as we migrate more of our sites to WordPress and build out more
landing pages. I have also been doing a lot of bug fixes and trying to figure out how the company operates so
that I won't have to ask too many questions. In time, I want to become a mid level Web Dev.

I'm loving it still and continue to work on side projects at home using Jekyll and learning React. Thanks for reading
I hope I can still help others achieve the dream. I will add tutorials soon.
