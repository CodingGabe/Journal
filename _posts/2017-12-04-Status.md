I am very aware that it has been awhile.  I am on the verge of finishing my new cool portfolio with better code and consistency. 

## Learning

Here me out real quick. I have been super busy learning everything I can to fit in with the role of a Jr Web Dev and I still coulnd't be any more happier with the career move. It has been nothing short of a blessing. Everyday is a new adventure and since I have been here, I have helped revamp the entire structure and flow of the company and I am very greatful for it. 

## What I've Learned
As mentioned before, I have learned how to utilize my talents of developing from scratch and applying it into WordPress. I have even honed my skills with small little things like CSS/SASS, whether it be flexbox, or other cool CSS tricks.  Learning on the go and researching is really the best thing to do if you are stuck but my Sr. Dev has been the coolest and best mentor. It helps that he is down to earth, super nice and open minded.  Seriously, I couldn't pick a better person to learn from for my first dev role. It's pretty cool to check back on my GitHub and see my old code compared to now though I haven't done any new projects save for some cool bots in JS. I plan on doing more projects starting now and using my new skills I've developed here.  I will post more info about what has been going on next week.  Thanks for reading!
