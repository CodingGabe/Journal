  <p class="center">I’m completely self-taught, but I didn’t do it alone. Everything I know is
     thanks to countless people who have freely shared their knowledge with the
     world. They inspire me, and I want to give back, too. Everything I learn, I
     document here. And there is always something new to learn.</p>
